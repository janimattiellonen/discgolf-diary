# Technique

This document tries to split up the different parts that are needed for successfull disc golfing: opening shots, timing, weight shifts, putting etc. Each part includes videos and other material I have found useful.

All throws mentioned in this article are RHBH (Right Hand BackHand) throws, unless specified otherwise.

Also do note that these are my personal notes, which I update periodically. Some information may be wrong, but constitutes my current beliefs in what makes a good throw.

## Throwing / opening shots

- spine should be straight during reachback (not bent left or right)
- during reachback, the hand should not curl behind your body 
  - this forces your hand to move in a circular motion and you will lose power and accuracy
- during reachback, the disc should be a bit (maybe quite a lot) away from your body
- plant foot should be approximately 90 degrees towards the direction your are throwing
  - when planting the foot, plant your toes first, and the heel of the foot
- both feet should not be on the same imaginary line that is pointing where you are about to throw
  - instead, the plant foot should be approximately one foot's length offset to your left foot
- your free arm should stay as close to your body as possibly
  - the more compact you are, the faster you spin (think figure skaters when they spin; they keep their arms really close to their bodies)
- when throwing from stand still stance, don't start the throw with full reachback. Instead, start from proper foot position and do a smooth and slow reachback first. This lets you get into a better rhytm. It feels more natural.

### Footwork during throw

It [appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR6yuA2P5mQ) that the [pros](https://youtu.be/wE2qWnVaqK0?t=83) often step on their toes during the throw, rather than planting the whole foot down on the ground. [Danny Lindahl](https://youtu.be/A2_OVPhLg0A?t=413) mentions that the only time when your weight should be on the heels of your foo is during followthrough or your plant foot.

### Holding the disc

- correct holding position: thumb should point forwards, not up
  - tilt your wrist slightly down


### Timing

- you should gain full reachback at exactly the same time when your plant foot is planted on the ground

### Weight shift

[Haeavy Disc](https://youtu.be/fD4u5_wbDec?t=50) mentions that during weight shift, your hip should be shifted towards the [sky](https://vimeo.com/64171158). If your hip is leaning backwards, you will lose power. Additionally, when turning your rear leg's knee, you should kinda point it downwards, that seems to support a correct way for your hips to turn properly.

#### Order of movement

0. legs
0. hips
0. shoulders
0. arms

## Physics training

## Field work / training routines

- always have a plan when before going for field work
- focus on one or two things during field work
- when practising putting, try to putt 5 times starting from 3m, then from 6m and so on, always increasing the distance when you score at least 3-4 out of 5 throws. Ifyou miss too many, go back one step. Rinse and repeat
- plan ahead
  - keep a list of issues you want to investigate / improve
