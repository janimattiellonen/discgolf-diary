# Technique

This document tries to split up the different parts that are needed for successfull disc golfing: opening shots, timing, weight shifts, putting etc. Each part includes videos and other material I have found useful.

All throws mentioned in this article are RHBH (Right Hand BackHand) throws, unless specified otherwise.

Also do note that these are my personal notes, which I update periodically. Some information may be wrong, but constitutes my current beliefs in what makes a good throw.

## Throwing / opening shots

- spine should be straight during reachback (not bent left or right)
- during reachback, the hand should not curl behind your body 
  - this forces your hand to move in a circular motion and you will lose power and accuracy
- during reachback, the disc should be a bit (maybe quite a lot) away from your body
- plant foot should be approximately 90 degrees towards the direction your are throwing
  - when planting the foot, plant your toes first, and the heel of the foot
- both feet should not be on the same imaginary line that is pointing where you are about to throw
  - instead, the plant foot should be approximately one foot's length offset to your left foot
- your free arm should stay as close to your body as possibly
  - the more compact you are, the faster you spin (think figure skaters when they spin; they keep their arms really close to their bodies)
- when throwing from stand still stance, don't start the throw with full reachback. Instead, start from proper foot position and do a smooth and slow reachback first. This lets you get into a better rhytm. It feels more natural.
- when at desired reachback, start the throw by twisting your left knee down and inwards. Your left foot's heel should be a bit off the ground when you do this manoeuvre (makes it easier to twist and to get some power to it). Twisting your knee makes your throwing hand get closer to your core area. Only when the disc is at the right pec, should you start accelerating the disc elbow first and turning your upper body and shoulders. Also use the hinge movement to further accelerate the disc.

### Footwork during throw

It [appears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR6yuA2P5mQ) that the [pros](https://youtu.be/wE2qWnVaqK0?t=83) often step on their toes during the throw, rather than planting the whole foot down on the ground. [Danny Lindahl](https://youtu.be/A2_OVPhLg0A?t=413) mentions that the only time when your weight should be on the heels of your foot is during followthrough or your plant foot.

### Holding the disc

- correct holding position: thumb should point forwards, not up
  - tilt your wrist slightly down


### Timing

- you should gain full reachback at exactly the same time when the ball of your plant foot is planted on the ground

### Weight shift

[Heavy Disc](https://youtu.be/fD4u5_wbDec?t=50) mentions that during weight shift, your hip should be shifted towards the [sky](https://vimeo.com/64171158). If your hip is leaning backwards, you will lose power. Additionally, when turning your rear leg's knee, you should kinda point it downwards, that seems to support a correct way for your hips to turn properly.

#### Order of movement

0. legs
0. hips
0. shoulders
0. arms

## Field work / training routines

- always have a plan when before going for field work
- focus on one or two things during field work
- when practising putting, try to putt 5 times starting from 3m, then from 6m and so on, always increasing the distance when you score at least 3-4 out of 5 throws. Ifyou miss too many, go back one step. Rinse and repeat
- plan ahead
  - keep a list of issues you want to investigate / improve

  "The correct sequence of events is that the plant foot is planted, then the heel lands, weight is transferred to it, and THEN the player begins pulling the disc in, and turning their left knee. NOT BEFORE."
