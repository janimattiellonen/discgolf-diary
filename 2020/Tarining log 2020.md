# Training log

## May 26th, 2020

### Duration: 1h 15min

Mostly stand still shots with midranges. I had 5 understable drivers (Leopard3, Sidewinder) with me as well. I really noticed that when I let my planting foot plant before I started the driving, I was able to throw past the 100m line several times.

### Duration: 45min

Today I just practised stand still tee shots.

I noticed that when I really stamped the ground with my planting foot, I threw at least marginally longer.
