## June 10th, 2020

### Duration, 1h 15min

In addition to normal practise, I tried control shots using a garbage bin, which I placed on the soccer field and then tried to approach. As I only had drivers and the distance to the garbage bin was only about 80m, I had difficulties in hitting the close area. It may have worked better with mid ranges.

### Duration, 45min

Mostly drivers. Again, I noticed that when throwing understable nd lighter discs sucsh as Sidewinders and when I allow my plant foot to really plant before I drive, I can often reach 100m or a bit more. What is weird, is that I tedn to almost reach 100m with Discmania Evolutionsm which is a 12-speed disc.

### Duration: 1h 15min

Mostly stand still shots with midranges. I had 5 understable drivers (Leopard3, Sidewinder) with me as well. I really noticed that when I let my planting foot plant before I started the driving, I was able to throw past the 100m line several times.

## May 6th, 2020

### Duration: 45min

Today I just practised stand still tee shots.

I noticed that when I really stamped the ground with my planting foot, I threw at least marginally longer.
