# Form and technique

Things that I believe in. Year 2020 update.

## Reachback

- keep your reachback low (hyzer shots)
- wide reachback


## Nose angle

Basically this means that nose angle is relative to the air flow. So a disc flying in and upwards angle is not automatically a "nose up".


Nose up

When the back of the disc is tilted back relative to the direction the disc is flying. In a nose up angle, the bottom part of the disc creates drag, which will result in slower speed and quicker fade to the left (RHBH throws).

Nose down

The disc is flying at the most aerodynamic angle relative to the direction the disc is flying.
