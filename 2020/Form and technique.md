# Form and technique

Things that I believe in. Year 2020 update.

## Reach back

- keep your reach back low (hyzer shots)
- wide reachback


## Nose angle

Basically this means that nose angle is relative to the air flow. So a disc flying in and upwards angle is not automatically a "nose up".

Nose up

When the back of the disc is tilted back relative to the direction the disc is flying. In a nose up angle, the bottom part of the disc creates drag, which will result in slower speed and quicker fade to the left (RHBH throws).

Nose down

The disc is flying at the most aerodynamic angle relative to the direction the disc is flying.

### Common issues

If you start with a high reach bach, then the path of the disc is aimed at the ground a few feet before you. This will force you to throw the disc with a nose up angle (or adjusting your angle, which will cause a dip in the swinging motion <- my comment). Start with a lower reach back to prevent dipping or nose up angles.

If you need to throw downwards, then try to keep your reachback below your collar bones.

### What to try

- try with low reach back, if throwing hyzer shots
- start with a low reach back and then tilt your wrist extremly and see what happens. Then gradully lessen the tilt of the wris throw again and see what happens.
