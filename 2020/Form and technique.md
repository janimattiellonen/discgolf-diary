# Form and technique

Things that I believe in. Year 2020 update.

## Reachback

- keep your reachback low (hyzer shots)
- wide reachback

## Hips

During full reachback, your shoulders should be fully turned, with both elbows at maximum distance from target, BUT, your hips should be at most 45 degrees towards back. This allows your hips to engage and use your upper body as slingshot. If your hips were turned fully backwards, your hips would just turn along with your upper body.

## Nose angle

Basically this means that nose angle is relative to the air flow. So a disc flying in and upwards angle is not automatically a "nose up".

Nose up

When the back of the disc is tilted back relative to the direction the disc is flying. In a nose up angle, the bottom part of the disc creates drag, which will result in slower speed and quicker fade to the left (RHBH throws).

Nose down

The disc is flying at the most aerodynamic angle relative to the direction the disc is flying.

## Dipping

Dipping occurs often, when you reach back high, above your shoulders.

ANother reason might be that you lower your elbow during the throw.

### Common issues

If you start with a high reachbach, then the path of the disc is aimed at the ground a few feet before you. This will force you to throw the disc with a nose up angle (or adjusting your angle, which will cause a dip in the swinging motion <- my comment). Start with a lower reachback to prevent dipping or nose up angles.

If you need to throw downwards, then try to keep your back below your collar bones.

### What to try

- try with low reachback, if throwing hyzer shots
- start with a low reachback and then tilt your wrist extremly and see what happens. Then gradully lessen the tilt of the wrist, throw again and see what happens.
