# Technique

This document tries to split up the different parts that are needed for successfull disc golfing: opening shots, timing, weight shifts, putting etc. Each part includes videos and other material I have found useful.

All throws mentioned in this article are RHBH (Right Hand BackHand) throws, unless specified otherwise.

## Throwing / opening shots

- spine should be straight during reachback (not bent left or right)
- during reachback, the hand should not curl behind your body 
- during reachback, the disc should be a bit away from your body
- plant foot should be approximately 90 degrees towards the direction your are throwing
- both feet should not be on the same imaginary line that is pointing where you are about to throw
  -instead, the plant foot should be approximately one foot's length offset to your left foot

### Holding the disc

- correct holding position: thumb should point forwards, not up
  - tilt your hand slightly down


### Timing

- you should gain full reachback at exactly the same time when your plant foot is planted on the ground
