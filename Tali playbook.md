# Tali playbook

June 10th, 2018

The purpose of this playbook is to act as a personal guide to Tali DGP.


## Hole 1: 216m, par 5


## Hole 2: 72m, par 3

Tee shot: Mako3, Truth or Buzzz SS. If windy, then slight hyzer. I tried with Roc3 but it faed left too much, too often to be of good use on this hole.

Second shot: pretty much always a putter.

## Hole 3: 81m, par 3

Tee shot: if choosing the left path, throw a Mako3 in an anhyzer. If choosing right, maybe a Roc3.

Second shot: most likely a putter, Mako3 or Roc3, depending a little on where the tee shot lands.
