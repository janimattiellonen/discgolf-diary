# Road to Tyyni (28.6-30.6.2018)

We have approximately 50 trainining sessions before Tyyni. That makes a 2 sessions per week. Those 50 sessions should be divided between different exercises, such as putting, stand still tees, x-step tees, up shots etc.

Main focus should be put on field practise and putting, rather than playing casual rounds.
