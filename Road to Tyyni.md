# Road to Tyyni (28.6-30.6.2018)

We have approximately 50 trainining sessions before Tyyni. That makes a 2 sessions per week. Those 50 sessions should be divided between different exercises, such as putting, stand still tees, x-step tees, up shots etc.

## Checklist

What to do before the tournament starts.

- get a decent umbrella
- make a list of clothes and other apparel you need
- read through the PDGA rule book
- study the courses, figure out what discs to keep in the bag
- see if you can test some of the courses in advance
- https://www.tyyni.com/competitor-info/ (see, which courses are used by MA3)
- https://www.tyyni.com/event-schedule/ (event schedule)

Main focus should be put on field practise and putting, rather than playing casual rounds. 

## Current focus

- practise putting, every week should contain at least one session of putting practise
- accuracy and consistency over distance, I have a lot of issues with the disc darting to the left and right
- create training programs for each week and try to stick to them
- if suitable, create main themes for each month
- try to gather footage of your throws, at least a couple of times per month
- try to build a consistent bag with as few (different) discs as possible, learn those discs in the bag well
- try to maintain a training diary (somethat similar to last year's)

## Training diary

### Week 1: 8.1.2018 - 14.1.2018

#### Training day #1 - 10.1.2018 (1h 30min):

##### Agenda

I've been reading about bracing and how the plant foot's ball should be on the ground when reaching back. Just before the actual throw begins, the plant foot's heel should be pressed down and only then should the actual throwing movement begin. When the heel is planted, you should try to brace the plant foot.

With these in mind, this session's main agenda is to focus on keeping the Line Of Play (LOP) and try to throw the discs as close each others as possible.

##### In retrospective

I tried focusing on planting of the plant foot's heel. It still feels akward and I get no power out of it. Need to focus more on this.

Also, I do need to start filming some of my shots so that I can see what I'm doing wrong.


### Week 2: 15.1 - 21.1.2018

This week consisted of three days of disc golf: 1 round in Tali, 1 partial round in Tali (holes 1-11) and 1 dayof putting.

#### Training day #2 - 18.1.2018 (45min):

##### Agenda

Today was an extra day that I used solely for practising putting. I tried to focus on how I gripped the disc and how it felt. Was it a relaxed or tense grip? Mostly threw from less than 6m. The idea was to get a good feel with many holed putts rather than making long putts seldomly.

#### Training day #3 - 21.1.2018 (2h 30min)

##### Agenda

In Tali. I practised opening shots on hole 2. For the last remaining hour I practised putting using Perfect Putt 360, which is actually a very good way to gamify your putting and makes it much more fun. Played two rounds with scores 127 / 360 and 111 / 360. Played one more round but the app kept crashing so I lost scores for the third round. 


### 14.3.2018 (Home field, 1h 30min)

Going over to a more simplified reporting.

The home field has been cleared of snow so I went there. It was somewhat windy and I started throwing in headwind and a lot of my discs turned abruptly to the right. After a while I walked to the other end of the field and started throwing in tailwind. Even if it is very useful to practise throwing in headwind, it still felt better throwing in tailwind and I felt much more productive and it was much more fun I stuck with it for the remaining of the time.

Intial throw (in headwind) feld bad and aimless. The goals were all placed in a row in about the middle of the field with few spaces between the goals. When I started to aim a certain goals and certain sides of the goals, I felt my throws were much better and at time quite precise too. QUite a few throws actually flew past a narrow gap between two goals, where I actually aimed too.

I threw all putters and midranges from a stand still stance. I had maybe 8 drivers too, which I threw using x-step.

Today's take away would be to:
- really visualize a flight path, use obstacles if possible
- keep it slow

### 15.3.2018 (Home field, 1h 30min)

Today was mostly a copy of yesterday, with the addition of me filming some of my throws.

I did pretty much the same type of exercises as yesterday. After warming up some, I tried to throw through a selected gap or side of the goal. It went quite well to day too. I alwasy ended each round with throwing some drivers. I actually had a quite good hit rate with the gaps too, even when using the x-step.

I mostly throw in tail wind. I tried one round with headwind: I really must use stable discs when throwing in headwind. When I threw Roc3, MD3 and MD4, the shots went pretty well but when I threw more understable discs, they pretty much went too much right.


### 12.4.2018 (Home field, 1h 30min)

Today was calm and almost no wind. Main take away from today was that I really focused on the hit. That is, in focused on trying to turn my body first and then accelerate. I didn't get correct movement out of my left foot, but I felt the shots going quite straight, albeit not that far. This got me the feeling that this is a good way to practise and that length of throws will increase as I train.

### 17.4.2018 (Home field, 1h 30min)

Today the wind was quite calm. I threw only in tailwind. Today I had no driverd at all, I kept throwing putters and midranges.

I tried focusing on control shots and whether I could get a correct movement.

Today's takeaway would be that when I kept my throwing hand a bit further away from my body, I got about 20m more in length.

### 19.4.2018 (Tali rugby field, 2h 10min)

I had planned to do my usual practises on my home field, but the weather was rainy, so I postponed it a couple of hours and used Tali's rugby field instead.

I did my basic opening shot training routines, nothing bigger. Maybe the best takeaway of today is that when I had a smoother reachback+acceleration, it felt a bit better. This needs to be investigated more.

In addition to basic open shots, I also practised sidearm. During the final leg of today's session, the sidearm throws felt better. 

### 26.4.2018 (Kivikko, 1h 20min)

Today was an early rise for me, as I had to be in Kivikko 5:45 in the morning). I played a round with another guy. Ended with +2 (both of us, actually).

I played "ok", but made a couple of silly mistakes such as teeing off way to short, having too much hyzer (especially on the last whole we played (currently hole 1).

One takeawea would be that, when playing a round (at least when playing alone), stop for a while and think about how to throw, how to stand etc). If needed, throw a couple extra shots every now and then to verify thoughts.

### 14.5.2018 (Home field, 45min)

Just a short monday session before work. Only mid ranges and putters. Again felt that if I kept the disc a bit further out of my body, I got straighter and longer shots.

### 21.5.2018 (Home field, 1h 20min)

Today I filmed some of my throws.

I concentrated on doing straight shots and keeping my arm at the line of play (LOP) all the time. At the final leg of today's trainign session, I tried a simplified runup; without going a full x-step, I just stepped sideways. I felt that I got more length in the throws and still got consistent throws. This is something to try more.


## 20.6.2018 (Tali, 2h 20min)

Started the morning with holes 1-6. Git frustrated with my throwing so I continued with opening shots from a certain pole towards the farther training basket. I quickly moved to hole 18. Today I set my personal distance record on hole 18. According to UDisc I threw something like 116m (about 6m short of the road at the end of hole 18).
