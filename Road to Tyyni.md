# Road to Tyyni (28.6-30.6.2018)

We have approximately 50 trainining sessions before Tyyni. That makes a 2 sessions per week. Those 50 sessions should be divided between different exercises, such as putting, stand still tees, x-step tees, up shots etc.

Main focus should be put on field practise and putting, rather than playing casual rounds. 

## Current focus

- practise putting, every week should contain at least one session of putting practise
- accuracy and consistency over distance, I have a lot of issues with the disc darting to the left and right
- create training programs for each week and try to stick to them
- if suitable, create main themes for each month
- try to gather footage of your throws, at least a couple of times per month
- try to build a consistent bag with as few (different) discs as possible, learn those discs in the bag well
- try to maintain a training diary (somethat similar to last year's)

## Note

At the time of writing (9.1.2018), I'm still in queue for a place in Tyyni. Currently at the top of the queue so my chances are good.

## Training diary

### Week 1 - 8.1.2018 - 14.1.2018

#### Training day #1 - 10.8.2018 (1h 30min):

##### Agenda

I've been reading about bracing and how the plant foot's ball should be on the ground when reaching back. Just before the actual throw begins, the plant foot's heel should be pressed down and only then should the actual throwing movement begin. When the heel is planted, you should try to brace the plant foot.

With these in mind, this session's main agenda is to focus on keeping the Line Of Play (LOP) and try to throw the discs as close each others as possible.

##### In retrospective

I tried focusing on planting of the plant foot's heel. It still feels akward and I get no power out of it. Need to focus more on this.

Also, I do need to start filming some of my shots so that I can see what I'm doing wrong.
