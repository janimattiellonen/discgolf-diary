# Road to Tyyni (28.6-30.6.2018)

We have approximately 50 trainining sessions before Tyyni. That makes a 2 sessions per week. Those 50 sessions should be divided between different exercises, such as putting, stand still tees, x-step tees, up shots etc.

Main focus should be put on field practise and putting, rather than playing casual rounds. 

## Current focus

- practise putting, every week should contain at least one session of putting practise
- accuracy and consistency over distance
- create training programs for each week and try to stick to them
- if suitable, create main themes for each month
- try to gather footage of your throws, at least a couple of times per month
- try to build a consistent bag with as few (different) discs as possible, learn those discs in the bag well
- try to maintain a training diary (somethat similar to last year's)

## Note

At the time of writing (9.1.2018), I'm still in queue for a place in Tyyni. Currently at the top of the queue so my chances are good.
