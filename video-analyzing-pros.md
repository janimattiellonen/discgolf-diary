# Video analyzing pros

This document will try to analyze how the pros throw and pros differ from each others.


## Paul McBeth

In this video, you can see that Paul McBeth's upper body doesn't turn almost at all. His upper body is kept at an angle of 90 degrees thoroughout the whole throw, except during the follow-through and initial starting point.
