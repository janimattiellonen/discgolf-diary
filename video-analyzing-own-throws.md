Comparing with [Seppo Paju Vlog: Backhand Form Breakdown | S3E20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uuwa6c3D9o)

- too much flailing hands just before throwing, calm it down(!)
- Seppo leans back on his left foot before throwing (body weight on the left foot). I'm not doing the same, or the movement is very minimal. Looks more like that I start in the leftmost position, instead of reaching it before the throw. So I can't comment on the weight shift.
- Seppo doesn't reach back that much
- Seppo's disc stays almost at the same place during reachback and the initial moment of throwing
- I'm throwing the disc at about the same height as Seppo. This is ok when throwing flat shots.
- Seppo throws with both feet on about the same line (he mentions this on the video)
