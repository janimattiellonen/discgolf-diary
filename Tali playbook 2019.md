## Hole 1: 216m, par 5

Tee shot: something stable or slightly unstable. Mako3 or one of my worn M3:s (light blue or pink). Maybe a little anhyzer. I tried opening with Roc3 and MD2 (or was it MD1), but they faded left too easilly, often going OB. 

## Hole 2: 72m, par 3

Tee shot: Mako3, Truth or Buzzz SS. If windy, then slight hyzer. I tried with Roc3 but it faed left too much, too often to be of good use on this hole.

If feeling lucky, you could also try a forehand skip shot with a Teebird. Before actually utilizing this shot, be sure to test it out with practise shots.

Second shot: pretty much always a putter.

## Hole 3: 81m, par 3

Tee shot: if choosing the left path, throw a Mako3 in an anhyzer. If choosing right, maybe a Roc3.

Second shot: most likely a putter, Mako3 or Roc3, depending a little on where the tee shot lands.

## Hole 4: 61m, par 3

Tee shot: Mako3 in hyzer. Maybe PA3 too. A putter might work too.

Second shot: pretty much always a putter.

## Hole 5: 77m, par 3

Tee shot: something stable. Discs such Mako3 tend to turn over and go OB. A TL3 or Roc3 work nicely.

Second shot: depending on how close, Roc3 or Mako3 or even a putter.

## Hole 6: 101m, par 3

Tee shot: if a par is ok, then mako3 in a light anhyzer is fine. Truth in light anhyzer works fine too. Easier to get controlled shots with midranges here. If wanting to aim for birdie, then maybe Leopard 3 or Valkyrie in a light anhyzer. Not the white sidewinder as it seems to have worn out too much and is a bit too much understable for this hole.

Second shot: a putter should be enoguh but otherwise Mako3 or Roc3.

## Hole 7: 103m, par 3

Tee shot: a birdie is pretty much out of question at the moment. I would go with Mako3, Truth or Buzzz SS. Again, easier to make a controlled shot. Otherwise, Leopard3 or a Valkyrie might work too (a little bit higher risk of getting the disc too much on the right side. 


## Hole 18: 83m, par 3

Be careful on this hole; the left side OB comes really fast towards you. The hole seems to have a tail wind quite often so be careful with understable discs. My Roc3 goes OB left very often.

Tee shot: not quite sure yet, what to utilize. Maybe Truth. If chosing Roc3, make sure you throw it flat or in a light anhyzer and keep the right side.
